# React Demo Playground üöÄ

Welcome to the React Demo Playground\! This project is a curated collection of interactive demonstrations showcasing various React concepts, patterns, and best practices. It's designed to be a learning resource for understanding common challenges and their solutions in a hands-on manner.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Demos**: A wide range of demos covering performance, security, and algorithms.
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: See the problem and the solution implemented for concepts like race conditions and stale closures.
- **Algorithm Visualizers**: Watch algorithms like DFS Word Search and Move Zeroes in action.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Includes a React client and an Express server.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a great developer experience.

## üìö Demos

Here's a list of the available demos you can explore in the playground:

- **Race Condition**: Demonstrates and solves race conditions when fetching data.
- **Stale Closure**: Illustrates the "stale closure" problem and how to fix it with `useRef`.
- **Captured Props**: Shows how props can be captured in functional and class components, and how to handle them.
- **List View Optimization**: A demo on optimizing list rendering with `useCallback` and `memo`.
- **Token Refresh Challenge**: A challenge to implement a token refresh mechanism.
- **DFS Word Search**: A visualizer for the Depth-First Search algorithm.
- **Move Zeroes**: An interactive visualizer for the two-pointers algorithm.
- **SOP/CSRF Demo**: A demonstration of Same-Origin Policy and Cross-Site Request Forgery.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd my-react-app
    ```

2.  **Install client dependencies**:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install server dependencies**:

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  **Start the server**:
    From the `server` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the client**:
    From the `client` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## üìù ESLint & Configuration

- **Client**: The client-side code is linted with ESLint, and includes plugins for React Hooks and React Refresh. The configuration can be found in `client/eslint.config.js`.
- **Server**: The server-side code uses ESLint with TypeScript support. The configuration is in `server/.eslintrc.json`.
- **TypeScript**: Both client and server have their own `tsconfig.json` files for TypeScript configuration.
